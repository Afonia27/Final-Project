# Final-Project
This is a final year student- project which was aimed to create the machine learning platform which would allow different industries to monitor the behaviour of their assets.

# Features: 
1) Pythong GUI application (PyApplication.py) written with use of PyQt5 capable of connecting to OB2 protocol supporting vehicles, using OBD2 connectors. Spesifically developed machine learning approach based on scoring algorythm allows vehicle state of health to be monitored. Two algorithms presented are: Linear Regression and Lowess regression. Additionally, there is a communication gateway created to AWS Sumerian through AWS IoT. 

2) Linkit One code written using Arduino IDE. First code (LinkitOne_AWS) allows connection of the Linkit One to AWS IoT. Second code (LinkitOneDataAqusition) allows data collection to be performed using the voltage divider, current and temperature sensors via customisable TestRoutine(). 

3) (MyRioProject Main_V2.VI) allows data to be collected using same sensors described in 2) but using MyRio-1900. 

# Details: 
The Hardware used: OB2 Connectors, Linkit One, MyRio-1900, Measurement rig.  

Software: Python, JavaScript, Arduino-C, Labview VI
